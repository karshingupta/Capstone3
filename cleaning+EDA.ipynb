The game utilizes a traditional top-down view and the player must navigate the protagonist Solid Snake through the game's areas without being detected. Detection will set off an alarm which draws armed enemies to his location. Conversations with Snake's allies and cutscenes are used extensively to advance the plot and gain more insight into it.

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (\"badniks\" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents).

Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn\\'t connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.\\n             \\n\\n              Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat \\'em up minigame called \"Tekken Force\", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion.

Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the \"Butterfly Effect\" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player\\'s choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has \"hundreds of endings\".

The replayability is crazy. And it never gets old with it too. Took everything great about the Soulsborne games and make it 100% better. I play with my overlevelled friend every time and we still fail sometimes (he’s on NG6) insanely difficult game loln                     n                     gorgeous graphics animations everything about this game is so beautiful. deserves all the hype it gets. If you have a powerful enough pc I definitely recommend you play it on there if you use keyboard you’ll want to change the keybinds because the defaults are ass. \"Tied as my favorite souls game with Bloodborne truly one Ill keep coming back too.\"]',\n",

The art is technically good but the aesthetic does very little for me too clean or something. idk wish I liked it but I do not incredible art a banger soundtrack a surprisingly charming storyline and a big red dog. hades has very smooth gameplay but after playing it for a while it just feels like youre doing the same 3 hit combo ove and over again which dont get me wrong that combo feels great to do but once i becomes muscle memory you kinda go into autopilot. also i think the boons are cool but i would like to see them change the flow of combat a bit more there are some cool ones like the grape boon that can change the way you play but most of them are just upgrades that dont really change the gameplay or strategy. other then those 2 small gripes the game is fantastic. \"People tell me this game gets really really good at some point but ive beaten entire games in the amount of time I gave this game.\" Não sou muito de jogo indie admito que joguei poucos mas devo dizer que Hades foi um dos melhores jogos que joguei na vida facilmente no top 15. Toda sua arte dublagem gameplay carisma dos personagens é tudo incrivel \"I cant shake the feeling that I am thoroughly bored playing Hades. Ive picked up Hades three times over the last few years and three times Ive found myself putting down the controller after a handful of hours especially after reaching the third stage and I couldnt figure out why it wasnt working for me.

The only drawback is the inclusion of linear stages that are too easy and not interesting enough that they shouldn’t have been included. A brilliant hard but clever and never unfair run-and-gun shooter. The platformer levels were unnecessary and are not as good as the others though. \"Ive had a bit of a troubled history with Cuphead. Before now Ive tried it on two different occasions both with varying results. My first attempt ended pretty swiftly since I didnt have a controller and the keyboard controls are... really bad! The game didnt quite jive with me at that point but my main problem at that point was the hell that is cuphead with keyboard controls. A year or two later I would play through the whole game and later the DLC in co-op with a friend. We did this over Steam so there was a bit of lag but I had a controller and a friend to help me through. I enjoyed the game a lot more to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together but it still didnt quite enamour me like Id wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything more of a personal one.\"]',\n",

I missed the sense of exploration from Dark Souls but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it.

No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I dont like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better because then its this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled or I said \"screw it\" summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly once you get that perfect parry timing down sometimes victory comes so fast that itn                     n                      almostn                     n                     feels unsatisfying. Happened to me with the final boss funnily enough. It only took me three playthroughs but I finally like this game! Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout though which isnt new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a \"correct\" way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you thats bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing thats bad and sucks and thats bad and sucks. \"Toujours en balance avec Bloodborne et Dark Souls pour le titre de meilleur jeu de chez FromSoftware.

Dont get me wrong its a great game but with REmake RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this being incredibly realistic yet stylized even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasnt worth it because the story barely changed but thats completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories but they also have different accessible rooms gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one and although thats also the case here both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way.

A resposta é sim ele é um ótimo jogo ! Better than Forces and Lost World but that’s not saying much. Overworld was cool to explore but it was trying too hard to be Breath of the Wild. Combat was literally just mashing Y which wasn’t fun. The platforming stages remove the camera control which just makes you fly off the side if you don’t know what’s coming up. At least it looked pretty aside from the generic looking enemies. \"Maybe Ill try again in the future but this isnt doing it for me. It was alright at first but soon outstayed its welcome.\" Excited for the sequel assuming they don’t completely change the formula again because this is a really solid foundation that feels fresh if a little bare bones at times. Super fun to run around and the music is really nice. Glad to have a story where the characters take the events seriously without joking every 5 seconds. The story itself is ok but the final act is clearly unfinished and rushed has probably one of the worst final bosses in the whole series which really undermines the ending a bit.

Andrew Shouldice goated fr 5/5 ⭑ \"Tunic is a wonderful 2D Zelda-like that feels like a love letter to the genre. Between an extremely charming aesthetic fun and interesting items and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre. The inclusions of things like a made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were a kid trying to play a game like Links Awakening. Discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player. I feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing. Level design is top notch in this game and I love all the secrets and hidden paths they provide using the games isometric view.

It has the best gameplay in the series easily but thats constantly interrupted by helicopter rides visits to Mother Base selecting your loadouts (even though for me it was the same loadout for almost every mission) and micromanaging your many recruits. Still while youre actually in the field the stealth gameplay feels excellent. But then it has the absolute worst story in the series. On the plus side... kinda... the vast majority of the story is on cassette tapes that are completely optional.\" Only 10-15 hours into this game and already its one of my favorites of all time. Let me illustrate why via some comparisons.n                     n                     Average Call of Duty mission: Walk in a straight line. Kill some people.n                     n                     Average F.E.A.R. mission: Walk in a straight line until you reach an arena where you will move around strategically and kill some people.n                     n                     Average Far Cry 3/4 mission: Drive across the world until you reach the location. Hide on a hill and snipe every bad guy at the base then walk inside. Or sneak inside I dont care. This funnels you into a segment where you walk forward and kill people.n                     n                     Average MSGV mission: You have 15 minutes to destroy enemy vehicles. Their path is marked on your Pip Boy. Call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank pick up the grenade launcher and ambush the tank. Next ride across a bridge to the other side of a river plant some C4 set up an ammo drop go prone and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. Next you get a message that a Jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. Its across the river. User your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard run across the river extract the prisoner park the Jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way. Find a place to hide so you can ambush the vehicle. This is just the first half of the mission. And if you die you can approach it a completely different way.n                     n                     This game feels like it takes Far Cry 4 and turns every gameplay element except for the open world up to 11. Instead of just shutting down the radios at a base you can destroy their comms equipment their anti-air radar and their electrical power. Dont just shut off the lights--shut off the lights plant C4 on the power source and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on.  But be careful because the enemies will react to anything you do. Keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing night-vision goggles.n                     n                     The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. Even though the game is relatively difficult (for me anyway) it always feels fair. Its always clear what killed me and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. Enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive Ive seen in a stealth game. Sure you can cheese the AI but you really have to work for it instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence. It really does feel like living through an awesome action movie rather than playing a video game.n                     n                     I only have a few complaints. One is that the open world really is empty; theres nothing besides enemy bases. I wouldnt so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semi-sandbox game or something equally clunky.  The goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living breathing world (like Skyrim or Far Cry 4) but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. It succeeds in that regard but I do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. My other complaint is with the base management portion of the game--it feels like a mobile game and takes away from the action.

A light and a heavy sweep that is pretty much it. The platforming is really good but also got annoying to traverse sometimes epseically with how many mountain areas there are.

Generally speaking I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth like racing games is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good youre moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night.

In the words of Godd Howard himself \"it just works.\" They tried so hard... and got so far. But in the end it falls short in a lot of ways. Fun first person stealth game! Mechanics are satisfying and story is interesting. The AI can act very strangely at times which can be frustrating. Apart from this I really enjoyed this game. \"A really good immersive sim with a focus on high-tier stealth gameplay. I really enjoyed both playthroughs but I really felt the good and bad hasnt aged as well.

Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Squares Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesnt play by the book.\" This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively and while it’s far from a difficult game each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger. \"Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that Id honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at. The battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people (it was a bit of a blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all.\" \"Honestly there just wasnt enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters dont encourage exploration the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPGs even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome.\" \"The best soundtrack Ive ever heard in a video game.\" Rough around the edges in the gameplay department but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.]',\n",

The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media.  I personally found myself more engrossed by the games study of the main character who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.n                     n                     On that note the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane and they really dont feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character.

Let me talk positive first The story in this game is really intrging with Arven and Team Star and while not the best Pokemon Soundtrack it has its bangers like every Team Star theme. Now onto the negatives the game is not well optimized for the switch at all. We have so many problmes both old and new as well as it overheating my switch recently. The Gym Test and raiding Team Bases are boring and monotonous. The Titan bosses are a joke with them being piss easy. I like the idea of an open world pokemon game but this game isnt that at all. There is an order to do things and even then you have to defeat team star bases to traverse further in the region. The Final battle is scrippted and I dont want that in a Pokemon game. I can understand why people like this game and I think its better then Sword and Shield but this is not a huge step up from those games.\" La puntuación viene por el rendimiento técnico del juego que parece yo jugando un partido de futbol 7 en mitad de agosto \"Ive never had such fun with a Pokemon game in a long time. I thoroughly enjoyed the exploration and trying to catch them all aspects of the game. The storylines were fun in their own rights as well. Victory Road is exactly what it is and theres nothing wrong with that Starfall Street dragged on but I appreciated the themes and backstory of Team Star(they have the best battle osts in the game short of the actual final boss) and Path of Legends was very sweet and relatable(It made me like Arvan which is impressive after his introduction in the game). I could even go back to it and still enjoy it. Its that good for all its faults. If you enjoy Pokemon at all you dont want to miss out on this one\" Its impressive that Game Freak has made \"the worst one ever\" four times in a row now closest ive ever been to completing a pokedex. 2/3 starters suck and while it IS open world there is a very strict level for each area so you still have to figure out the right progression path on your own. crashes a lot but it has pikachu so its okey]',\n",

O jogo resolve usar uma abordagem mais simples com apenas uma arma e alguns tipos de munições que em suma maioria é utilizada de maneira pontual ao decorrer da jogatina. A gameplay simples e relativamente repetitiva não é um problema aqui visto que o jogo possui um enredo rico em detalhes e que consegue desenvolver sua premissa com perfeição.

              " '[In this first game the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that while not lacking in variety are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series) but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly. Sinceramente eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho mas caramba é torturante escalar o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista apesar de interessante não tem quase nada de carisma sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.n                     n                     Para um início mesmo levando em conta as limitações ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth e isso matou a graça de muitas missões pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar e as vezes os npcs (os loucos) simplesmente me empurravam eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão. Eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que não fosse obrigado a fazer para seguir com as principais que são todas praticamente iguais e nada recompensadoras. \"As someone who played Assassins Creed back in the day I have to say that I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand I appreciated the games unique setting and storyline which offered a fresh take on the action-adventure genre. The games visuals were also impressive for their time with richly detailed environments and realistic character animations.\" Weird nostalgia for this one. I remember my dad used to laugh when I mowed the pilgrims over with my horse. \"(Played before 2023)n                     n                     I played this when I was younger a lot and I am pretty sure the first YouTube video I ever did was recording me diving into some hay as a child. I then played it again more recently a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city running around and exploring while fighting enemies but you definitely felt like there couldve been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming. Overall a fantastic game and I think it has actually aged very well especially the parkour. It is also one of the best looking early-era PS3 games on the console which should also be mentioned.\" nostalgia bias: it was a good game]',\n",

The haptic feedback with the weapons all feel great especially with the Enforcer (I always love a good shotgun). There’s lots of neat level designs and environments that caught me off guard and were very enjoyable to play. The story was entertaining enough but is forgettable the  best parts involving the conflicts between the main villains and gets quite funny at times.

The setting is unique and the main character is one of my favorite in games. Selene is such a cool determined character and I really loved the combat and effects. This was really the first next-gen game I played on the PS5 and it didnt disappoint. My main issue is that it is a roguelike but it doesnt have any replabilitiy. I really didnt feel any reason to go back through this game and only came back after my initial playthrough for the DLC which definitely helps me want to replay through it. But you cant really control or change builds to have drastically different play styles. Youre still dodging and shooting with an active reload for the most part and that is it with the variety coming from the enemies and biomes. I hope we get a sequel that turns it into a true roguelike letting me focus on melee or dashing or tanking shots or being a glass cannon or something to add more variety that this game needed.\" Muito muito bom.

What really shines is the level design soundtrack and main mechanic of bouncing with the shovel. The death defying jumps make the game stressful but it doesnt make it too challenging. I would give this one a try if you like 2D platformers it seriously is a classic.\" Here’s a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty: do you actively avoid playing games from the pre-3D era because of their lack of availability or because their foundation is comparatively primitive and therefore jarringly inaccessible? The reason can’t be because these games are locked in an archival vault for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isn’t as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their “transcendental experience” to their peers with a Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. Maybe it’s because I spend too much time on the internet but I’ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when I was in high school. Older video games on the other hand are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly as someone born in the early 3D era many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. Conversely there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era and the shift to 3D left them bewildered. They’ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. After a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3D visuals to an almost cinematic extent games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. One of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was Shovel Knight a 2D side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.]',\n",

As with many Square Enix games they always deliver when it comes to music & overall aesthetics especially when compared to KH1 & other Final Fantasy titles. The gameplay is greatly improved upon over Kingdom Hearts 1 in almost every regard: camera movement combat platforming; everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed. With that being said this is where the story begins to take a nosedive in every direction. I personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the Roxas portion of the game. Without skipping cutscenes its going to take a long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable.\" \"In my review of KH1 I remarked on how if I played these games as a kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites mostly due to how the game had a sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was a Disney title. This game felt like it had a better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes Disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime-ass vibes that Square Enix was known for. Combined those two elements make for a game that I feel if I had played as a kid it would have changed things the same way Sonic Adventure 2 did for me. That right there is a powerful energy that I can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone. Unfortunately I played this a little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally but I absolutely recognize that power when I see it. The game pretty much improves upon the first in every way with better locales fancier and flashier gameplay a more intricate plot the whole nine yards. My only major gripe that I have with it is I think the second half could have been streamlined a bit better and they could have made both acts for each world happen in a row rather than having you go through every world twice. Outside of that this is a particularly special game.

Im glad that the game actually found a final version and wasnt just a concept with nothing done with it! As for the actual game itself it was neat. I liked how they focused a lot on perspective based puzzles not only with the main gimmick of resizing objects based on perspective but also with things like lighting and making 2D objects 3D and resizing yourself to solve puzzles. However there definitely were a lot of points where you are just walking through hallways which felt like padding. It seems like while the game concept was really cool there really wasnt a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game \"the next portal\" like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off. That being said Portal is a really high bar so not reaching that expectation does not a bad game make since this game is still definitely worth playing IMO. The story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics which was cool. All in all it didnt disappoint and I would recommend giving it a play!

Im not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one \"thing\" like portals or in this case perspective means that its not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do. Each puzzle is really cool obviously the use of perspective to fiddle with objects is trippy and fun to just mess with. My personal favorite part of the game was the level design and the way it made you feel like you were spiraling ever deeper in a dream. From the endlessly carpeted halls of a hotel to spooky dimly lit backrooms I was on the edge of my seat on this ride. At the very climax of the game when you have been spiraling ever deeper trapped in this dream the entire thing is kind of thrown away. While the ending still works (avoiding too much for spoilers) it was a bit of a punch in the gut to go from OH MY GOD IM DYING to its all good its the end :). Still I think this game is one of my favorites and everyone should play it. Clever and mind bending]',\n",

The collective unconscious the masks that people wear to conceal their true selves and references to ancient Greek and Japanese mythology are all motifs that are usually present in SMT and Persona games. This has led to a consistently murky tone throughout the series in the undertones when not overtly. While the darkest game in the series is up for debate theres no debating which is the brightest: Persona 4. Released just 2 years after the decidedly grim Persona 3 and on the same engine P4 delivers an overall joyful and optimistic tone that helped it stand out not only from its predecessor but from previous Persona and SMT games as well. This may seem counter-intuitive as the focus of the story is on finding a murder suspect who kills 2 people within hours of the games beginning. Yet its the moment-to-moment dialogue the soundtrack even the color palette (the yellow theme provides an overall sunny disposition) that makes Persona 4 not only a joyful experience but a joy to experience.\"]',\n",

The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design.

Other games have more to offer and feel better to play and all the \"hip and cool\" concepts of this game are mostly at the end of ones playthrough to postpone playing it (if youre not playing Kirbies in order). An alright game to spend an afternoon on. They really took the best kirby game and made it even better.

No geral embora conte com um ou outro inimigo interessante no geral os inimigos não tem metade do carisma da série principal o que tbm se reflete um pouco nos poucos chefes do game na qual  dois em especial são bem criativos e legais  porém os outros não tem o mesmo tempero que a série clássica.

Porém acredito que o maior responsável pelo rage que esse jogo sofreu seja seu protagonista Dante que não tem 20% do carisma do protagonista original e somada a péssima estratégia de marketing usada na promoção desse jogo na época apenas reforçaram a aversão ao personagem o que infelizmente se refletiu na repercussão do game.

Even now when you go back watching the cinematics from this game makes it feel so stylish and modern. Just a phenomenal job from an art perspective. I also like playing it I just have less to say about that. Squaresoft was absolutely dominating the RPG genre at the turn of the millennium; Final Fantasy Chrono Cross and Legend of Mana are just a few examples of the types of games which were experiencing their heyday in the late 5th generation. They dabbled in the action RPG subgenre before but with the release of Vagrant Story in 2000 the \"action\" aspect was amplified and the RPG aspect was significantly toned down. Players expecting a similar experience to previously mentioned games would be in for a big surprise as this title lacked all the tropes you would expect in a typical RPG; no levels no parties no item shops no grinding. Vagrant Storys main appeal at the time and currently is its diversion from the norm of what RPGs were expected to be. Its no doubt that VS offers quite the unique experience; whether thats a good thing or not though is up for debate.]',\n",

The level themes are all very unique the soundtrack is great and the gameplay is the boost formula we all know and love so why is it that this game didnt stick with me the way most other sonic games didnt? I guess while the gameplay is cool most of the level design revolves around controlling sonic in a 2D space and Ive always been more of a fan of the 3D setpieces sonic runs around instead of the 2D segments in modern sonic levels.

Greece during the Peloponnesian War was a dream setting for an Assassins Creed game that I had been asking for back when I was a big fan of the series. I probably dont have to think too hard as to why it took me so long since I had heard a lot of negative things about the game which I now realise was from a lot of AC fans feeling spurned by the new direction. Despite enjoying Origins I wasnt chomping at the bit to play an iterative sequel. So yes thats why I waited so long but Im glad Ive played it now since I adore it. Origins was mostly an action adventure game with some RPG mechanics which incidentally describes most games these days. Ultimately the RPG side of the game wasnt particularly substantial while it watered down the fun stealth action and parkour from earlier entries in the series.n                     n                     Assassins Creed Odyssey is absolutely an RPG though. It very wholeheartedly embraces the genre.\" quando joguei fiquei viciado louco obcecado doido.n                     n                     A trilha principal desse jogo... pqp em Ubisoft *dei um beijo bem molhado na Ubi.

This is the game that made me a SuperGiant fan and is my second favorite game in their catalog behind Hades.

Everything is so well crafted between the strange almost cyberpunk semi-dystopia utopia of Cloudbank the wonderful interactions between Red and the Transistor and the most incredible video game soundtrack I have ever heard bar none. There are so many small details that serve to elevate this story and world to another level that I can only be appreciated on repeat playthroughs and the ending is just perfect. I like the combat a lot but it isnt the highlight and everything else overshadows it though it is still designed well and used in interesting ways especially when you bump up the difficulty.\" Classic supergiant goodness.]',\n",
              " '[Tries to capture the same magic that RE4 has but doesn’t have as interesting combat or characters. \"awesome gameplay. traversing and fighting your way through the nightmarish setpieces is super cool and enjoyable. every weapon you get has its purpose and i found myself using all of them which i can appreciate a lot as it adds variety. my big criticism is that the story is just okay the characters are uninteresting and the dialogue/writing is quite frankly bad. the characters reactions are so tame compared to the dire situations theyre in and rarely do they emote with any intensity. their lives are constantly in danger but they sure dont act like it. the gameplay and environments are genuinely great enough to warrant 4 stars.\" Action games generally operate on the concept of player empowerment granting the tools to overcome any challenge without a scratch as long as players have the skill to realize that potential. Meanwhile horror games operate on the concept of playern                     n                      disempowermentn                     n                      giving the bare minimum in order to foster a tense atmosphere so balancing the priorities of each genre seems like mixing oil and water. Resident Evil games are famous for trying to do so but they usually break into a horror-centric first half and an action-centric back half without a true blending of the concepts. The Evil Within meanwhile actually managed it but had to alienate players in some key ways in order to do so. Firstly the logic behind the story is nearly impossible to follow at first leaving players unable to find their footing confused at why the progression is so jumpy and unfocused. Then the mechanical restrictions feel like they’re equally arbitrary: Sebastian can only initially carry about twelve bullets and not even a full healthbar’s worth of recovery. He can barely run at all and in order to alleviate any of this you may have to bank up green gel over the course of multiple chapters. It can seem like the game is simply trying to make action feel scary by stressing out players with cheap deaths but once you commit to learning the game a brilliant method behind the madness reveals itself. While the storyn                     n                      isn                     n                     mostly nonsense the abstract nature of it allows for level design suited to a wide variety of challenges. With new mechanics being introduced at a steady pace players are constantly kept on the backfoot and thus disempowered even as their growing mechanical knowledge empowers them. The shallow capacity for supplies is an obvious form of disempowerment which prompts players to spend resources cleverly but their abundance between each fight empowers players to use their entire toolkit freely. The upgrade system empowers; the below-par baselines make unupgraded stats more of a problem in the face of scaling challenge. For every give there’s a take and thus a harmony between action and horror is reached. As stated before though the “take” for that brilliance is a frontloaded sense of disempowerment with players having to get through most of the game before they’ve experienced enough character growth and skill development to redress the balance. So I really can’t blame anyone for bouncing off of this game but I also truly believe that as of today (less than a week away from RE4 remake) it’s the best merging of action and horror in gaming. Resident Evil 4 is pure satisfying action Dead Space commits to bloody horror but The Evil Within is purely… both. actually really fun but rpcs3 is being a little bitch rn chatinho Can never get into this game. Garbage scripted events at every turn. No thanks]',\n",
              " '[Should have won best OST 2022 \"May revisit it eventually on pc but there is not enough here to compel me to finish the game aside from the soundtrack which is very very good. Got about half way through and if I was more into rhythm games (or better at shooters on controller) I would probably just bite the bullet and spend a few hours more in it but I think Id get more enjoyment from just listening to the soundtrack.\" Sou uma pessoa simples FPS ritmíco e metal perfeita combinação. \"Oyun Kullanıcısının elinden asla tutmuyor Sıkılıyorsunuz ve aynı bossu durmadan cok basit mekanikler ekleyerek önümüze sunmuşlar. Şahsen bunu oynayacağıma Doom oynarım oyunun sonuna kadar bile katlanamadım.\" Imagine o que aconteceria se você misturasse a temática visual e sanguinolência de Doom com as clássicas mecânicas de jogos rítmicos baseadas em apertar botões no tempo certo. Bom essa mistura existe e se chama Metal: Hellsinger. Se você já jogou Doom alguma vez na sua vida provavelmente já reparou que um dos pontos fortes da saga são suas trilhas sonoras marcantes que conseguem tornar a experiência de cortar demônios ainda mais prazerosa.n                     n                     Pensando nisso a desenvolvedora The Outsiders resolveu criar sua própria versão do clássico de 1993 porém com a adição de uma mecânica um pouco diferente. Ritmo.

Quanto mais preciso você atira mais dano e pontos você faz. Uma das partes que eu mais achei interessante no jogo é seu objetivo aqui seu objetivo não é só completar a fase mas também fazer a maior pontuação possível.n                     n                     Ao todo o jogo possui 10 capítulos cada capítulo termina com uma Boss Fight e ao completá-lo outros 3 desafios são liberados no mesmo cenário.

Em sua jornada você deve destruir hordas de demônios e seus líderes para enfim travar um combate com a Juíza e recuperar a voz que lhe foi roubada.n                     n                     Mas vamos falar do que interessa a trilha sonora. A música é o ponto alto do jogo e como é de se esperar ela é impecavel. O jogo conta com 15 músicas autorais escritas e compostas exclusivamente para o título. A melhor parte é que cada música conta com a participação especial de grandes nomes do metal internacional. Entre os artistas convidados estão Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy) Mikael Stanne (Dark Tranquility) Tatiana Shmayluk (Jinjer) Serj Tankian (System of a Down) além de outros grandes nomes totalizando 9 artistas convidados.n                     n                     As músicas são muito boas e qualquer um terá uma experiência agradável jogando porém é claro elas se tornam muito mais prazerosas para aqueles que não só já gostam do gênero mas também para aqueles que já escutavam os artistas convidados previamente.n                     n                     Os pontos altos do jogo obviamente são focados na música e no gameplay. A trilha sonora acompanha perfeitamente o tiroteio frenético da jornada através do inferno e a experiência se torna mais prazerosa com o sistema de ritmo fazendo com que você tenha que acertar tiros esquivas e recargas no tempo da música. Também é bom citar como ponto positivo o fato dele estar disponível gratuitamente no Xbox Game Pass.n                     n                     Não tem muitos pontos negativos no jogo mas se for pra citar algum talvez seja interessante citar o tempo de gameplay que em uma zerada apenas pode ser muito curto e não compensar os R$99 reais investidos. Claro esse tempo pode aumentar caso você jogue em uma dificuldade mais elevada ou caso você deseje fazer 100% do jogo. Eu joguei por causa que eu vi o nome Serj Tankian(sou uma pessoa simples).

              " '[\"I was worried that the retirement of Nathan would leave Uncharted without anything to carry a story as I never considered Chloe a very interesting character in 2. Thankfully Lost Legacy compensates nicely with a shorter story that doesnt ask too much of the player while still hitting all the correct beats. The gameplay improvements made in 4 make a triumphant return though the climbing is still annoying. Each big set-piece is dynamic and exciting the game never lingers too long or moves on too quickly. On the open-zone section in the beginning I have conflicted feelings. On one hand the dialouge between Chloe and Nadine is charming and entertaining without feeling too artificial and I enjoyed the scenery. However this series has always been about maintaining momentum. I now have a newfound appreciation for the sublime pacing of the older games after experiencing what it feels like to lose that forward-moving feeling. The game definietly picks up the tempo again afterwards but I cant say the section left a good impression overall. The rest of the game is exactly as one would expect. The villain is nothing special the platforming is cool and rhytmic but not very complex and there arent really any themes to delve into beyond the absolute minimum stuff. I dont mind though I am satisfied with the game being a nice adventure to relax with a role it easily fulfills.\" The final Uncharted game (for now atleast) and its....fine. Bom A dlc do melhor jogo já feito logo a melhor dlc já feita. Fun game but generic as generic can possibly be. Amy Hennig as a writer was the soul of this franchise and without her Uncharted became stale. Neil Druckmann gives you a  modest american movie but as a videogame he gives the most generic story possible and fails to write Chloe as a charismatic protagonist - he transformed her in another Nathan Drake -. Every action scene is copied from another Uncharted game and the structure add nothing to mechanics and functionality. The villain is bland and the male characters are there to fill the misandry quota. All the merits of this game still belongs to Uncharted 12 and 3. Play only if you want a little movie experience or watch the cutscenes on YouTube. Everyone told me that Uncharted was a videogame franchise with no bad games well what do you call this garbage then?  The Story is that Chloe hires Nadine (from the fourth game) to help her retrieve a ancient Indian artifact this is an odd idea for a story because Chloe knows about Nadines history with her friends Nathan and Sam Drake yet she works with someone who hates them and doesnt think she will turn on her and when she finds out that Sam was helping out Nadine feels betrayed assaults Chloe and abandons her until she apologizes but Nadine says that she is now only helping Chloe out for the treasure but dont worry she gets over it randomly after they help a trapped elephant it happens so fast that there isnt even a moment where Nadine is completely over it she randomly is and they both act like it never happened because the writing is terrible when it comes to the character moments and after they are trapped with Sam him and Nadine both argue a lot because of their history but when interacting Chloe trusts the girl who assaulted her and tried to kill her former lover and his brother more than she trusts her former lovers brother which feels like Feminism where the two girls get along where as the man is played for a foil to it which is frowned upon in this and since Nadine never shows any remorse for what she did in the last game to the protagonist and Sam does it makes Nadine even less likeable than she already was and ruins the story completely and studios need to stop this garbage.  The Characters are no where near as good as their last previous appearances thanks to Chloe being sympathetic to a former villain over a man Nadine worsened by trying to make us like her by being an unlikeable villain to hero tale without even regretting her actions and made Sam to feel more of a nuisance than a main character to the point where he doesnt even bring his own grapple hook (even though he would never do that) stop writing feminism over males feelings in games and shame the people who think otherwise the villain is barely anymore interesting than the first games main villain with his history with an old kingdom but it doesnt go beyond that and I enjoyed the traits of the second games main villain more.  The Graphics are as good as the remastered versions of the first 3 games with some moments are awe (the best being when you run off a train heading off a broken bridge even if the second games train scene was much better) but no where near as good as the fourth game and not as many memorable moments to be on par with games 2 and 3 they have better looking events than the first game though.  The Gameplay is the same as before only shorter to the point where its less than half the length of games 2 3 and 4 and in chapter 4 you can optionally find coins to retrieve a ruby bracelet but no other moments like it make it feel random silenced pistols were a great addition but chapters 5 and especially 4 feel far too long and could have been shortened to make 2 more chapters especially with how big you have to travel for completing chapter 4 is.  The Music is not as memorable as before due to less moments to have them takeover the scene for atmosphere and the song at the end \"Borders by M.I.A\" is a bland and forgettable song.  Uncharted: The Lost Legacy brought back the Uncharted franchise to consoles and made me wish that it had stayed lost.]',\n",

The dodge was cool but way too frustrating to use and while I loved exploring the city I think that the second half isnt as strong because it is basically the same thing as the other two games. Sewers and Lab. I also didnt really like Carlos too much honestly and found him annoying and I was also missing the city in chaos part.

Nemesis is cool though I like the funny zombie guy. I wish he showed up more frequently and stalked you all throughout the map but the times he does show up can be exciting and the man runs at you like a football player which is awesome. All in all the game is definitely memorable and worth checking out if you like resident evil stuff but it is definitely the most flawed and occasionally frustrating game of the classic style so beware.\" Um excelente jogo com ótimas ideias e uma gameplay claramente superior aos títulos anteriores. Porém peca em um início confuso e áreas redundantes como a Torre do Relógio. Ganha um pontinho por ter uma história levemente mais novelizada com maior desenvolvimento que os anteriores.

Im also not a big fan of mobile games as they are typically shallow affairs that never hold my attention. So for Marvel snap to be my most played game to release in 2022 and a near ever-present in my daily life they must have got something right. The key to marvel snap is that its easy to pick up and hard to master. Each card is both a part of marvels illustrious history and a chess piece that can change the game if used correctly. A game of marvel snap lasts less than 5 minutes so its easy to justify trying different combination of cards as picking cards with poor synergy will not cost you much.

The ability to upgrade your cards so they are 3D holographic brings back childhood memories  alongside giving the game a engaging gameplay loop. Upgrading your cards daily challenges and season challenges keep me coming back day after day.  Not being able to buy unique cards is one of the best decisions the devs ever made and allows me to come back day after day unlocking new cards getting a holographic card collection my childhood self could only dream of and switching between strategies to keep the game fresh is a wining formula  where the marvel licence is only  the cherry on top of a delicious cake.\" \"A card game with simple mechanics.

You’ll always be behind on the new cards and every game you lose will remind you this problema can be solved with your credit card.n                     n                     Just get it you’ll think. It’s just the price of an indie game per month to keep on top of the Season Passes you’ll think. It won’t bankrupt me you’ll think.

I can now state with confidence: that tracks. \"I played this game every day between October 1 and February 7. The gameplay of Snap is excellent and for a while the treadmill is really enticing—I earned new cards at a pace and in an order that successfully sparked some inspiration in the new combos I could try. When that happened I could play dozens of games whittling the new deck and strategy down until I got something new that did the same thing and so on. As deck variety increases so does strategic complexity and the game is excellent at getting you time and opportunity to explore its systems; theres not many explicit tutorials but the card effects are simple and the at your decks grows feels so natural. It must be said the card game itself feels really well-designed and balanced and for many characters right on theme. I had a great time for a long time.\"]',\n",

While the story scenario animation artwork and music are phenomenal it leaves you desiring more of a game. There are a ton of cutscenes and QTEs and the gameplay itself is fun but nothing of real depth. Dont get me wrong I didnt hate it and enjoyed the ride despite this essential being an interactive movie with some shmup or beat em sections. The shmup sections I actually found to be tedious and not really all that fun to play. The gameplay in these sections feel like they are too easy and youre just locking on until something blows up with little player agency. It lacks weight until the end where the difficulty is cranked in these sections. As previously mentioned the combat is serviceable but nothing to really write home about. I think more combos and variety wouldve put this another tier up. I think the game gets maybe a little too bonkers and self-indulgent at points with Asura and his rage but it kind of adds to the insanity of the story. Id recommend playing this once as it genuinely is a really fun ride. Just dont go into it expecting a DMC or Platinum game level of action game perfection in regards to the combat system and gameplay. 3 1/2 ★\" Anime: The Game.

Peace Walker is by all accounts a worthy canonical chapter in the saga with its own dignity in terms of the themes covered and consideration for the in-depth development of the characters. On the gameplay experience aspects it is also a pretty good transposition of the mechanics from previous games to a handheld console especially considering the major limitations of the psp: clearly affected by this are mainly the ai of the enemies the complexity of the environments and a certain overall fluidity of the experience which can initially seem quite clunky. Good choices were therefore to model the gameplay in a relatively short mission structure to increase action sequences over stealth phases and to be inspired by the type of games proposed by the highly successful titles on psp such as Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The result is a very fun game with various customization options and a very high level of replayability with an almost arcade-like flavor in improving your gaming execution that may annoy those who rightly believe that such a title deserved more attention but which in the end considering the finished product turns out to be decidedly remarkable. gud game live laugh love kazuhira miller Paz e amor]',\n",

With it being a prequel of sorts to Nioh 1 it can be played in isolation and I honestly recommend it it’s much tougher than Nioh 1 but because of this it makes it easier to jump into a Nioh 1 playthrough since it’s the same game but with less mechanics overall such as burst counters and Yokai attacks. Worth playing through don’t be discouraged by difficulty or the more daunting things like the loot system and menus. Ahi va de nuevo]',\n",

It’s flawed but oozes charm. Like the bizarre dialogue coupled with iffy voice acting with an extra dose of horrible sound mixing should be a recipe for a bad time. But I found it very endearing.

Either way it doesnt really matter to me.n                     n                     The gameplay is a mix of linear combat levels with some minigames and exploration of the police station in between them. The minigames are fun on the first go but I never went back for seconds. And exploring the station was fun the first time but after that you just kinda mindlessly run around it looking for new intel pick-ups after every level. It’s nothing special but offers a nice repose from the combat. The combat is pretty simple but effective. You have a sword and some guns. I mostly played aggressively not using guns for the most part. Just slashing around and finding it very fun. Attacking and parrying. This being a game made by former Ninja Gaiden devs I’m sure there’s plenty of secret techniques that deepen the combat. But I’m a scrub and don’t know anything about that. I did discover block canceling tho and felt like a genius. The actual game is pretty hard. Those ninjas man… A nice challenge is a good thing but the checkpoint placement really grinded my gears. Dying could mean having to repeat like 5 minutes of constant combat which gets pretty annoying. But other than that I honestly had a fun time.\" \"Damn I wish they still made rough janky action games that got critically eviscerated like the PS2 days. No no not like that its too rough and janky and look at those reviews its being critically eviscerated\" You know I knew exactly what I was getting into with this game and yet somehow I still left disappointed lol. While this game has a lot of charm and fun combat ( can be clunky at times )  there is still so much wrong with this game. \"As someone who saw promise in the developer’s previous works and after seeing the interesting flavor Wanted: Dead was putting on display in its advertising I was truly hopeful that the game would finally squeak past that threshold of being just short of greatness and deliver something flawed but truly excellent or interesting in its own right.

But great animations doesnt excuse the downright inferior ghost designs (the fucking thing looks like minion knock offs) and the constant back n forth made it a slog to get through. You may say that the first game is similar with the backtracking. Though I feel the first title is all about exploring this one environment making you attached to it.

              " '[\"Valkyrie Elysium truly is a long-lost PS3 game that took its time to come out. Im happy that the Valkyrie franchise is back in some capacity I think after this game its gonna be a while till we get something else but I will take my wins whenever.\" \"So to start off...my first thought about this game when I saw it was it was a sequel to the Valkyrie Profile series. Thats not quite what this is but Ill explain what I mean below.\" Game looks kinda nice I guess.  Takes the Valkyrie game series name and uses it as toilet paper though. As my first time playing a Valkyrie game it fell a little flat. Combat is actually really fun and is ultimately what kept me playing. The story is a bit bare but the companions you pick up along the way have a charm of their own. The environments are beautiful but a little bland although this IS a game about a world already in ruin. This music is pretty cool and I enjoyed the multiple endings. Ultimately I had fun. I think the most interesting thing about Valkyrie Elysium is that it’s not a story about saving the world. It’s about what happens in that period where everything is ending already. Most of my time playing this game was spent in ruins fighting the vengeful spirits that still roam the land alongside those spirits who chose to fight with me and listening to the voices that had long perished. And although Odin tells you from the beginning that your efforts are done so save it actually walking through Valkyrie Elysiums world the question haunted me: What is there left so save? This question is at the heart of the game. [Spoilers follow] The Valkyrie a hollow shell at the beginning distanced from the world she wants to save becomes more and more involved over the course of the story – through the help of the spirits that chose to stay with her. And in the end the player must choose what to do with that involvement. The different endings all give a different answer to the questions “What is there left to save? What is there left to fight for?”. The so-called “true ending” has a somewhat cynical answer to this: That the gods who were responsible for the worlds’ demise will not see the next one. Another ending plainly states: heterosexual love. In every ending the world we walked through in the game ends. The agency of the player is to decide what happens next. This feels like a low budget PS2 game and I mean that as a compliment. It has a fun battle system and it looks nice. The rest of the game however is for lack of a better term fucking boring. The story is generic the stage design is bland and while I do like a few characters they are also generic.]',\n",

It may be my favorite in the series. The amazing art story and combat system really make this game something special. It also has probably the best OST of any Castlevania game and that says A LOT considering how the series has consistently great soundtracks. The characters were also really great and interesting and I loved the twist in the story because it didnt feel forced or thrown in it actually worked very well and this was one of the games where the ending actually made me cry a little.

              " '[Since I just played the first one too most of my opinions are basically comparisons but I do think both games are very good with different highs and lows between the two. This one has an actual story this time unlike the last one which was a collection of somewhat thrown together \"get to and beat the guy\" levels threaded together loosely (especially in the DS version). This time theres a thread that runs from the start to the end and is helped by the new-to-the-series voiced characters and script which thankfully doesnt quite fall into the overly quirky style that later games would become defined by. The levels while occasionally a little too long are still very engaging though im not sure which games levels really kept my attention better. Despite being \"DC Super Heroes\" its still hugely Batman skewed youd have to wait for another sequel to really reach into more DC character territory but this one had a nice roster of fun characters. I didnt have much interest in 100%ing this time round but ive definitely come close before from what I remember just that it takes a while and im not sure I want to play the same levels twice in a row immediately.

Fantastic music and a GORGEOUS artstyle where every level has interesting things about it. The collecting is really nice too as someone who doesnt like having to one-hundred percent games I definitely want to do it with this game as the levels are setup to minimize backtracking if youre trying to get everything. The music as well needs to be mentioned as it is amazing and fits every levels unique artstyle perfectly. It is a bit on the shorter side but Id rather have a game that leaves me wanting more rather than thinking it was too much. I think my biggest complaint is that it is a little too easy. I dont normally play platformers and I found it not that challenging where I usually messed up jumps because of timing rather than precision and movement. I dont mind games being easy but I think I wouldve liked a little more challenge especially with the enemies. Theyre all quite simple and are more objects rather than creatures you counter despite their cute designs. I also liked the little story details we get and it really plays well into the less is more concept. Overall a great game and for the price it is a steal!\" Love the visuals a lot This game is an absolute treat! Its everything that I want out of a retro-styled platformer.

Theres a dab move though so this game is turbo based on that basis alone. The writing and the voice acting delivery of said writing was kinda cringe to me personally but idk other people might like it.

I dislike meandering story-telling where all of the characters are idiots and the pacing is constantly slowed down to explain things to you or being forced to \"regroup\" and stop your exploration.n                     n                     Ive just been having such a hard time getting into JRPGs lately even though it used to be one of my favourite genres to play and I dislike that I dont have the patience for this genre any more.

Tooie fixes every problem the first has and expands on it in so many ways its kind of hard to believe.\" Watching paint dry over here. I thought Banjo 1 was tedious but this stretches the world out to double the length and forces a bunch of transformations that make you walk across it 3-4 times more than the original game. I didnt grow up playing this one so its automatically worse than banjo 1. While Ill always think the N64 was home to some of the worst gamefeel ever made its hard to deny it had a really unique design culture. Banjo Tooie has a bunch of fun ideas but fuck the Minjos Im glad the mole guy died. A great sequel to an amazing game keeping things fresh while also staying true to the original One of my favorite games of all time.n                     n                     Banjo Tooie is a 3D platformer collect-a-thon. A lot of its charm comes from the humorous dialogue between characters. It’s packed with quite a bit of dark humor and situational comicalities throughout each of the 9 worlds.n                     n                     The worlds are vast and eclectic meaning you’re left with very little to be desired and a lot to explore.n                     n                     Being a sequel to Banjo Kazooie Tooie has a lot to live up to and it did not disappoint. I didn’t really want to compare the two but oh well everyone else is 🤷🏻u200d♂️.n                     n                     One key difference is that in Kazooie each session in a world is somewhat discontinuous. What this means is you can collect 99 music notes in a world leave and come back and you’ll have to start back at 0. Whereas in Tooie everything you collect is permanent and you don’t need to worry about losing progress.n                     n                     Tooie is a lot more legato when it comes to how the worlds are interconnected and honestly that was something I really loved when playing it.n                     n                     Oh the camera is much better in Tooie too.n                     n                     A common complaint I see is that there’s an overwhelming amount of content and people that played Tooie after Kazooie thought that took away from the experience. I actually played Tooie first and felt that Kazooie was lacking.n                     n                     One significant aspect of games that greatly affects the flow of a game is the feeling of progression. This is something I think Banjo Tooie does extremely well. There are consistently new unlockables whether it’s new combat moves mobility utilities worlds secret paths etc there’s always something new. However because there’s so much there is a LOT of backtracking especially if you want to collect everything. For me this was a good thing but I know it’s not for everyone.n                     n                     There are many places in each world where you can get stuck due to not having unlocked something elsewhere or just not being able to figure out a puzzle. As a child this was a fun challenge. I cannot tell what it would be like playing for the first time as an adult.n                     n                     I’d be lying if I said nostalgia didn’t have something to do with how I feel about this game. But I assure you both playing (and 100%ing) as a kid as well as in my 20’s I gave this a solid 10/10.n                     n                     There’s also a multiplayer mode which are all the mini games banjo and kazooie come across in the campaign. I had 3 siblings so we had a ton of fun playing these but I imagine not many of us play couch multiplayer anymore so this is more of a side note bonus thing.

Theres no interesting plot or characters the world is boring and uninspired in terms of both its design and its contents theres no notable music the bosses are awful  the bafflingly terrible changes made to the game feel and dungeon layouts done by Capcom are just as prominent here as they are in OoS but by far the worst aspect is the dungeons.

That being said it was also quite a difficult game to proceed through gameplay wise. The gameplay itself which is the management system it works around is pretty simple for the first few days due to the income of simple abnormalities at first. It does a good job of guiding you through the basics of how the gameplay works and which ability works best for the abnormalities you are constantly trying to contain but that also ties into why the gameplay can be reaaally frustrating at times. Youre basically always having to keep track of which employee is best to deal with the abnormality youre working on with the consequences being that your employees are always at risk of panicking/dying or the abnormality in question breaches which can easily end in a game over in the later days of the game.\" death is near. i think this game killed my previous computer]',\n",

That isnt to say this game is bad but more that the controls and level design is better in those games and while this games OST is certainly better than super castlevania 4s it doesnt even come close to touching rondo of bloods OST. All in all a neat more obscure castlevania game but nothing essential to the castlevania playing experience imo its just a solid castlevania game and thats kinda it\" Pretty sure this is my favorite Castlevania now. You play as a buff guy from Texas and he has the Bionic Commando grapple swing. Just what the series was missing. Solid game. I was a bit annoyed with a few of the stages and bosses but most of the game was great. I was a big fan of a lot of the weirder visuals especially toward the end. Might return to it another day to play as the other character. Yes. This was a very great Castlevania game. Not very long not too hard awesome music (expected) awesome character models fair difficulty and cool level design (expected). I was very content playing this and on my second play through one day I’ll make sure to use the other character you can choose. I am so glad this is on the switch.

There are so many moments where you just.. can’t save everyone. The other games have similar moments but this one melds it into the gameplay so perfectly and precisely. Every map is vast with history communities and density. They genuinely do feel like actual locales rather than “a video game level”. That goes both to its benefit and detriment from a gameplay perspective but from an                     n                      storyn                     n                     perspective it’s pure bliss. We follow our heroes through lush forests sprawling plains harsh mountains scorching deserts etc. You slowly proceed through this seemingly endless war each map becoming more and more hopeless.n                     n                     I should also preface that you need to experience this story blind. I know it’s very hard to do as such with how much the middle plot twist is spoiled to everyone but I encourage you to stay as blind as possible.n                     n                      Genealogy’sn                     n                     narrative is fantastic not only for a Fire Emblem game but for a piece of media in general. Seliph is one of my favorite video game characters of all time because of how we follow his journey from suffering a harsh young life but growing to become a fine young man himself capable of what his mission is. Once again I’m not going to elaborate so the reader can find out what happens themselves but the story is no exaggeration simply masterful.n                     n                     Generational storytelling is one of my favorite tropes of all time. Seeing how descendants of a generation will remedy the mistakes regrets or failures of their predecessors has always been so engaging to me. Whilen                     n                      Genealogysn                     n                     latter half isnt nearly as narratively complex as the former half its story about the next generation of heroes is among one of my favorites for this trope. Ily Seliph.n                     n                     Presentation also goes a long way of course. Every music track in the game adds to the atmosphere so heavily it’s easily one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard on the Super Famicom. Some tracks were so masterfully composed I nearly shed tears I couldn’t believe how well it played me especially when I can rarely cry at soundtracks anymore. The graphics can be hit or miss especially with the character portraits but the maps and environments are top notch. I could really look at them for so long.n                     n                     I think that’s pretty much all I could think of to say aboutn                     n                      Genealogy of the Holy Warn                     n                     . As a game… it’s a mess. Possibly even objectively bad. But as a story a piece of artistry… it’s an undeniable masterpiece. It’s certainly not for everyone I’m aware but it is worth experiencing in full at LEAST once. Not my favorite Fire Emblem because of the gameplay but definitely the best narrative and cast of characters in my eyes.n                     n                     Also ever notice how so many of the people who say this game sucks (or other classic FE games for that matter) are Three Houses fans or have Three Houses pfps? curious ….\" \"A great game and my favorite of the Fire Emblem Franchise. The game is kind of easy for a Fire Emblem game and its clearly not the best tactical experience youll get in this franchie. This game is more a playable story than it is a game with a good story in it. Every element of Genealogy serves the narrative the strenght of the characters reflects their developpement and their place in the world the challenges are constantly evolving to flow with the story story events that you cant even participate in take place during fights... This allow the universe to feel real and we can feel the stakes of whats happening. Its clearly not a game for everyone it can be slow and tedious at times and the story can be less interesting in the second half but if you think a game using his mecanics mainly to tell a compelling plot with memorable characters may be for you Ill blindy recommand that you at least give it a try. Dont be afraid of the difficulty if youre not used to play old Fire Emblem games you can save litteraly every turn and you have broken characters among your units.\"]',\n",

I can see the good parts like the art and the music and the atmosphere but its almost like the game uses that to masquerade as a better experience than it is.

              " '[Ótimo jogo porém na minha opinião ainda perde para o DKC 2 de SNES. O que não é nenhum demérito já que DKC2 é simplesmente atemporal em vários aspectos! im sorry that the first DKC game I played was tropical freeze The peak of level-based 2D platforming that simply refuses to miss at every turn. The soundtrack is a never-ending bop that pairs with each level brilliantly and makes you want to just monkey dance to it rather than play the level. I would list the tracks that I love in this game but I am afraid that would be damn near every song in the ost. The level design mechanics and themes of this game are elite and set a new bar for what can be done it platformers in general. Every idea was placed squarely on the table and it never dwells on one idea for long enough for it to get stale. When mechanics do return you find yourself saying \"Lets go zip vines are back\" rather than losing interest because they are so fun and implemented so expertly. They decided to skip the pleasantries of making a boring world one boss and just make every boss in this game great and it really is a blast to play the different characters. I appreciate the trade-offs that come with selecting each character and it is a lot of fun to pogo around as Cranky. Stickerbush Symphony Returns This game is oozing with fun energy. DKC Tropical Freeze is an interesting and charming 2D platformer. I may give this game another playthrough sometime soon as just writing this review is making me want to play it all over again.

              " '[\"Theres genuinely nothing funny I could say about Thracia or anything that hasnt already been said about it that would do it justice. Theres no other FE game that matches its raw gameplay integrity and absolutely genius ideas with Genealogy at least coming in close second. For every bullshit thing the game throws at you the game gives you quadruple the amount of bullshit to use against the enemy - like there are so many brave and master weapons and staves that basically get handed to you on a silver platter and while there are a few chapters that are trial and error actually figuring them out genuinely feels so good - no other Fire Emblem game gives me this much dopamine. Hell I made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game going in depth on every strategy I utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play. I think its worth mentioning that this is the first time a game has compelled me to do something like this.\" amei as mecânicas do jogo espero que apareça em outros jogos ou algum futuro remake me diverti bem mais com esse comparado com o fe4n                     n                     envelheceu bem demais e algum dia vou revisitar mesmo com toda raiva que passei em alguns mapas \"Im never touching this game for the rest of my life. I have never felt such hatred inside of me until I played this game. The story and characters really carry this game. Take me back to Genealogy please. Also fuck the ballistae in this game.\" \"Its the kind of game that will kick in the stomach laugh and continue to kick you until its get tired but when it does it will extend you a hand and treat you like a hero. Play it if you have some experience with tactical games otherwise you will have a bad time.\" Oh my God. I can’t believe I slept on this game/ kept it for last thinking it would be too hard for me. Despite being on the SNES it’s an absolute masterpiece of a game which can be attributed to the fact it tests the SNES to its limits being the final SNES game ever made released in 1999 nine years after the SNES’s inception and 3 years into the N64’s lifespan. Shouzou Kaga was evidently opposed to making a Fire Emblem game on the N64 believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters and that philosophy to keep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1’s Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles. That too went well but let’s focus on FE5. This game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful to say the least. Still after strategizing for hours constantly saving and loading states and rage momentssense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remarkablen                     n                     Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it. While FE4 had its fair share of dark moments this game is straight up depressing you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. By the beggining of the game you feel completely lostand confused by the mechanics and the difficulty just like Leif feeling lost on this brutal war. You are not a group of experienced and heroic knights leading for victory you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire and youre obviously going to get obliterated against such force. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units a hope slowly rises and you go from \"how the hell am i going to survive from this?\" to \"Hey i can actually do this!\" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. And then you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire. Its actually even harder then before but you have so much more experince with the gameyou dont feel as powerless as before. And after youve gone through so much beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to youn                     n                     This is phenomenal storytelling and you can only have this in a videogame that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. Thats why remake of this game is probably going to suck since theyll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.n                     n                     Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management and i love this you can capture enemies to steal their equipmentbut its significantly harder and risky to dosince youll deal much less and take much more damage. But since you dont get much chance to buy and repair weapons you really have to pay attention the resources you have and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you facen                     n                     Fatigue is also a new mechanic which if you use a unit too much you wont be able to use them in the next chapter which makes powerful units more tricky to use adding another depth to the gameplay. Youll only want to use them when necessary so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units i gotta say this was hard to get used to especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4 but it didnt took long to for me to actually like itn                     n                     Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller but focused maps with multiple objectives and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. You have defense escape fog of war(which isnt THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. Also each map has its own unique objective which makes every single map even more memorable. Varied objectives makes each chapter fresh which is something ive never seen in an SRPGn                     n                     Weakest part of this game imo are the characters in FE4 you have a lot of optional conversations between characters and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit in FE5 most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.n                     n                     But i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolledn                     n                     Though this doesnt mean that this game has no good character writing far from it Leif is one the best written main characters ive ever seen in a game. Like i mentioned before you start of the game as powerless and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. Just like Leif whos a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. This is obviously no coincidence Leif represents the player but unlike most games that have a main character which is\"representing the player\"Leif isnt a silent protagonist his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writingn                     n                     Im not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4but still this is one the finest SRPGs ever made. Its frusturating for sure but its so well designed in nearly every aspect its impossible for me to hate it. Id highly recommend it if you liked FE4 and simply want to see more from this world.]',\n",

The NoAH additions such as the character routes really help the game feel like the fully realised experience it was meant to be originally. I cant say I thought they were all bangers but the depth they add along with what they add to the gameplay experience overall helps give a sense of thematic finality if that makes sense.

The ending (which I watched) makes the game seem a little pointless.n                     n                     Overall its fine I guess. Im done.\" So like XIII I also platinumed XIII-2. a marked improvement over 13-1 with alot more things to do and sights to see. exploration has been improved drastically with there actually being shit to do other than fight! wow! seeing a bunch of locations from the first game in different time periods and seeing how they begin and end is a great feature and an interesting way to justify reuse of assets. the characters were interesting to me and I was really hoping noel would get to see Yeul again. at the same time Caius has a great motivation and I kind of wanted him to win too! the combat system here is one of my favorites in the series. being able to use monsters as your third-party member allows for tons of variety. the plot can get pretty confusing at times however and the ending was wildly unsatisfying. but all in all it might just be my favorite in the trilogy \"shouldnt have smoked that shit now im in oerba 300 -AF-\" Gets an extra half-star for nostalgic reasons.n                     n                     Very conflicted on this game. It was not needed and if you learn more about how they had plans for multiple games as part of the \"crystallis\" collection then you start to connect the dots as to how we ended up with a game with so much potential. If you were to have a new cast of characters to play with but in the same world as FF13 it would make more sense and not trash the original. You could still have characters from the original game show up as NPCs. This helps connect the worlds. But Serah and Lightning couldve been replaced. \"my stars are because of nostalgia about the time i played this dont get your hopes up the story is messy at best and the gameplay is... something\"]',\n",

This is also the game where lore really starts to kick in motion a little which also later develops even more in future games.

The ending to cold steel 2 was amazing. It really was something that I was not expecting. Solid follow up In my opinion the weakest game in the series currently. The pacing on the first half of the game is very bad but gets very good eventually! \"What a fuckin snoozefest of a game. After Cold Steel 1 took its time setting things up I expected Cold Steel 2 to deliver on its storyline and show us the civil war first mentioned in Trails to Azure. Instead the game hardly shows any of the actual civil war and has you do a lot of miscellaneous things that dont really matter too much in the grand scheme of things. Crows death at the end of the (second to) last dungeon was the only moment that made me feel anything. Then rather than end on what seemed like shouldve been the ending you start playing as thr protagonist from the previous arc and get to beat up this games protagonist which was admittedly cathartic in a way. Then the game temporarily goes back to the structure of cold steel 1 to show the characters back in their school life before throwing in a 25 floor randomly generated dungeon at the last minute.

I played Primehack and had an enhanced FOV since the original was so narrow so I cant comment on any original hiccups in that department. The map and world design is incredibly atmospheric with every new area feeling like a visual treat Phendrana Drifts in particular. Prime is a commendable transition into the 3D space for the franchise and it being the first attempt makes all missteps easy to forgive. Backtracking is a little rough (maybe just me but I never felt like I totally got the hang of which elevator went where without double checking) the mid-game feels unfinished (you fight 3 bosses play for 5 hours and then fight 3 more at the tail end) and some weapons feel underutilized (I barely touched the super variants until the Metroid Prime fight) but its a blast and really retains the feel of a 2D Metroid game at its core with platforming as a main focus.\" \"Neat game. Controls were a bit interesting to get used to but the game is built around them so there wasnt really much of a problem. I do wish the FOV was a bit bigger and you could see where you are landing when you have to do platforming though. This game does a good job in putting the metroid formula in 3D but because it is now in 3D theres a lot more nooks and crannies that things are hidden in so you have to definitely have your eyes more peeled than the 2D metroids. The map system is also more difficult to understand than the 2D metroids. I didnt even really have a problem with the mandatory mcguffin hunt at the end or the constant backtracking since those are kind of staples of the Metroid series and serve to give you more opportunities to find secrets by constantly returning to places you have been before. Putting a fast travel option would completely defeat the purpose imo. At the end of the day this game didnt blow me away like it did for so many other people but I can still see a decent game when I play one and this is definitely that.\" \"honestly i dont think theres anything out there as magical as this\" \"I wasnt satisfied with my previous review on this so Im just going to try again.\"]',\n",

Re-joguei ele agora em 2023 porque estava fazendo uma maratona de jogos do Sonic e ele tava na listan                     n                     Sempre gostei muito do Unleashed desde que eu joguei pela primeira vez no PS2 eu já concluía que aquele era meu jogo do Sonic favorito ganhei meu PS3 em 2020 e joguei 1 vez a versão de PS3 e agora joguei pela segunda vez e conclui mais ainda que ele é meu favorito da franquian                     n                     10/10 I actually like the Werehog levels as well as the Boost levels. The bosses are all lackluster though except for the final boss. The final boss is awful. \"When I played the PS3 version of the game as my first experience with the HD version of sonic unleashed it was kinda frustrating. The medal hunting kills the pacing of the game if you are just trying to go through the levels yet the game doesnt really make an effort to tell you to slow down and find all the medals since the quotas are usually manageable on their own before they get spiked for no reason at the very end. The levels are fun as hell though I dont even really have a problem with the werehog outside of maybe a few werehog levels overstaying their welcome. The game just has a fun vibe to it I like it. The framerate on the PS3 version also sucks play the xbox version instead preferrably on series X where it runs at 60 FPS and is incredible. If you play this just make sure to collect lots of medals and do as much stuff as you can so the game wont just cockblock you from finishing it near the end.\" \"Sonic Unleashed isnt a terrible game but there are enough gripes I had with it that made the game a slog to beat. The werehog levels while sometimes enjoyable overstayed their welcome and the combat isnt all that great. The sun & moon coins were also a pain in the ass to collect for a good chunk of the game and will probably take up a good majority of your playthrough. It gets a bit easier to get the amount required to complete the game once you unlock the extra acts but unless you really pay attention as you play the levels youre going to find yourself replaying them quite a bit if you want to make progress. Eggmanland is one of the most infuriating levels I have played for quite some time. Not only does it have an absurdly big difficulty curve from every other level but the level drags on longer than the other werehog levels. Considering my lack of skill at Sonic games Im honestly surprised I managed to beat it let alone without having to grind for extra lives. Even with that in mind it still took me over an hour to do it.\" definitivamente um dos jogos do sonic ja feitos]',\n",

More characters more minigames more places just more more more more more. It is impressive how much content they managed to pack into this game and while that is definitely a strength of this game it also comes to the games detriment at times IMO. Mostly in due to the fact that the game is longer than the other yakuza games and the story kinda lags behind because of it. Each character basically has their own unrelated story that ends in a cliffhanger that is resolved in the final chapter and I dont really think said cliffhanger was worth all the buildup...? idk man if youve played the series enough to make it this far you already know what you are getting yourself in for and if you for some reason want to start with this theres enough content to warrant it still being interesting i guess. The final boss also sucked and that always leaves bad aftertastes in my gamer mouth. All in all I can see what this game was going for and it wasnt BAD per se but I didnt like it personally.\" \"This game is sort of a reverse of yakuza 4. Cause while I thought the story of 4 was incredible I thought the gameplay could be a better. This game is the opposite. The 5 characters are actually fun to play as (except 1) and the side content of this game is actually the best in the series. The 1 character that isnt fun is just lame and doesnt have very much depth to his style. Saejima actually feels good to play as in this game. Im not sure if they just changed how he felt or I did something wrong in 4 but hes cool now. Akiyama and kiryu are akiyama and kiryu so theyre obviously fun. Hakura was vey unexpected. I mean its a rhythm game breaking up an action beat em up game  yet honestly it works pretty well. The side story minigames were pretty cool (especially kiryus) and a welcome addition although I didnt do them much because this game took me FOREVER. I wouldve liked to do them more but I was growing impatient and just wanted to finish the game. The story in this game is just okay at best. 4 does the split paths crossing into one much better and all the different stories were just kind of tiring me out at that point. There were some really sweet heartfelt moments here and there but it wasnt enough to make me 100% invested like other games. The music also wasnt as strong as the last game which isnt a dig at this games music its still good. Just not AS good. So while the story was a little too long and convoluted for my liking the gameplay was enough to keep me hooked on this series. Another yakuza banger.\" \"Very bloated game.

This game holds a special place to me and I have deep nostalgia for it but its also just a solidly designed platformer.\" \"Super Mario Land 2: Yoshis Island is one of the best platformers Nintendo has ever made. The game controls great in a way that even the likes of its predecessor Super Mario World does not. Every part of Yoshi’s moveset just feels natural. The flutter jump is great to adjust your jumps the egg shooting is super responsive and the ground pound is so iconic that even Mario stole it for later entries in his series. The level design compliments these controls well as the exploratory nature of many of its levels put these skills to perfect use. To be fair there are a few times where instant death pits and spikes feel unwarranted but by no means is that much a dealbreaker.n                     n                     But not only do the controls hold up so does this game’s graphics. The children’s book art-style gives the game a sense of whimsy that can still be felt 30 years later. Additionally thanks to the Super FX chip the 3D graphics are just mindboggling and add to the already impressive graphics for the time. Even today the graphics still hold up shockingly well and is just a testament to how strong of an impression this game has on its players. Everything to the music to the enemy designs are just so delightful and full of that Nintendo charm. It’s easily one of the best platformers Nintendo has ever put out and its clear to see why this single game spawned a franchise of its own. Now if only any of the other titles lived up to this entry…\" \"Even as someone whos not really a big fan of 2D platformers I absolutely adore the two Super Mario World games (I know theyre only really linked by name but I like them for the same reasons). With extremely satisfying if a bit loose controls and complex but not overly tedious level design I think these two games really embody what 2D platformers should be and make me understand why people love Mario a series which I otherwise find just okay for the most part so much.\" \"2D mario is at its best when its being the least 2D mario possible\" \"Pure art. An expressionist adventure that links the Mario and Yoshi franchises together by adding a phenomenal depth to their lore. The story is simple yet touching. The art style is some of the best Ive seen by Nintendo; each frame looks like a Van Gogh painting. The levels have an excellent difficulty curve starting off with simple levels and ending with platforming challenges of an unbeknownst complexity that will test the numerous skills youve acquired with Yoshi within the six worlds. The boss fights are likely the best Ive seen in any 2D platformer. The experimental 2.5D sections work remarkably well and show the great capabilities of the SNES as a console. The greatest SNES game Ive played thus far the greatest prequel Ive played thus far and possibly the greatest 2D platformer Ive played thus far. Will be revisiting.\"]',\n",

This of course doesnt change the fact that this is still an unfortunate step down from DMC 3 that clearly suffered a lot from a lack of development time along with having a plethora of weird gimmicky ideas that only serve to drag down the overall experience. On the other hand though I cannot think of many examples this is a prime example of a game thats carried so hard by one element being insanely good that it can make you somewhat overlook the fact that almost everything surrounding it doesnt really do anything for you.\" \"Impressively unfinished but still pretty great.

They compensate for this with far more characters than the main console versions including some that wouldnt even appear in the follow up to this on console either like Azrael and Zsasz. As one of the earlier Lego games of its kind (along with Complete Saga and Indiana Jones) the hub world is just kind of there in both versions rather than the interesting stuff that would show up later (originally on the sequel to this one) and as such once youve beaten the main games you will get caught on a fair whack of grinding if you dont have the cash to pick up the keys which are required for a lot of free play stuff. Essentially its a fun mindless playthrough but once youve beaten the story it isnt the most engaging to 100%.

Además los encuentros con los otros humanos se sienten como fortuitos y suelen hablar sobre sus miedos sueños y la visión de su mundo ideal y los problemas que ellos ven con el mundo actual. En resumen tienen menos dialogo que en la saga Persona pero dicen cosas mucho más interesantes (bajo mi punto de vista).n                     n                     El sistema de combate es por turnos y tiene cosas que me gustan y cosas que no.n                     n                     Tu equipo esta formado por tu avatar y los demonios que hayas reclutado los demonios pueden morir en combate y puedes llamar a otro que tengas para sustituirlo lo unico que gasta un turno. Si se muere tu personaje se acaba la partida y tienes que cargar del último puntonde guardado. Hay ataques de daño que puede ser fisico o magico y los magicos hay de muchos elementos distintos y también hay ataques de aumentar tus estadísticas bajar las del rival provocar problemas de estado y curar tu salud y/o maná.n                     n                     Las acciones que tienes para atacar en tu turno depende de la cantidad de demonios que tengas en el equipo máximo 4 acciones pero pueden aumentar hasta 8 si haces ataques eficaces o criticos pero también puedes perder acciones si fallas ataques o haces ataques inmunes para tu rivales.n                     n                     Y uno de los problemas es que siento que el combate se centra mucho en aumentar tu evasión y reducir la precisión del rival para que el rival falle y asi tu puedas pegar muchas más veces.

Its a fun puzzle game and its satisfying to work out how to solve everyones problem. I really did enjoy the story; it felt very Star Trek. Im always down for a Roman aesthethic and I liked the thematic link between the player builing up knowledge based on past loops and how civilizations like the Romans were built upon past civilizations.

The OST goes hard no matter what region you play in with the japanese/european soundtrack giving more funky vibes whereas the american version gives off a lot of atmospheric serious vibes. Gameplaywise this game is a very directionless little game since there is this time travel mechanic they got going on where you have to go to the past to fix the future but you can also collect time stones to get the good futures which makes the whole going into the past thing kinda pointless since its significantly easier to just go for the time stones instead but then the levels are designed to be wide and open so you can explore them which defeats the purpose of that if you are just gunning it to the end and can you see now why I said it feels directionless? No matter how you play it its still defintely worth a play for sure and Id reccomend it pretty highly just for the experience since you dont get vibes like this in a sonic game that often.\" So…whilst they were making sonic 2 over in America with yuji naka the rest of the original sonic team were left in japan to work on a different sonic game for sega’s next business venture…the sega cd…of night trap fame of course.]',\n",

But thats very much it.\" wow the super nintendo really got shafted for castlevania. the other members of the big 3 16-bit machines got bangers while this one is just... uhhhhhhh its fine.n                     n                     i dont think the 8-directional whip an inherently bad idea. especially not after a god-tier game like CVIII that would leave any series in a \"where do we go from here?\" state. the problem is SCVIV totally fails to build challenges around it. the best it comes up with for most of the game is placing enemies slightly below the player that are best dealt with by tediously bouncing the whip around and some preeeetty bad grappling hook platforming sections. the death and dracula fights actually make some decent use of it but its way too little too late. and that would all be one thing but they seemed aware that the game would be way way easier than its NES predecessors so they filled the back half of the game with an actually obnoxious amount of tedious instant death traps. where the late-game levels of CVI and CVIII are back-breaking but extremely satisfying to piece together (the medusa+knight hallway is a prsitine example) SCVIV really feels like work near the end. the finesse just isnt there.n                     n                     presentation wise the game punches unbelievably far above its weight as a near-launch title. it really is stunning i just wish it could play as good as it looks and sounds.

I was expecting this crazy big fancy masterpiece of a game that people talk about when they discuss the best super nintendo games of all time but eh I guess I wasnt really feeling this one too much compared to other games like rondo of blood or castlevania 3. Yeah you can change directions in mid-air and whip in multiple directions but I felt like the level design was kinda forgettable (with some exceptional mode7 gimmick levels) and the OST was more of this atmospheric type thing they had going on instead of the more upbeat type of sound id normally expect with castlevania.

              " '[\"Ive never seen a James Bond movie. The only intake of 007 media is from this game. And to be honest until I played through the entire campaign on Switch Online the only experience I had with this game was from glimpses of my cousins playing through the campaign or from the short bursts of multiplayer theyd allowed me to participate in. Playing through the game Ive realized how important this game truly is to the higher FPS canon. Non-linear levels based on objectives along with fast-paced gunplay. Varied weaponry that feels so good to maul down enemy combatants as they stalk you relentlessly. A smooth yet intense soundtrack from Grant Kirkhope. The dedication to its source material. Goldeneye is still one of the best movie to game adaptations in history and people who complain about the controls are missing the point. Yes there are frustrating aspects to the gameplay but when you get used to it you realize you can gundown enemies with one hand and sip a glass of whiskey on the rocks in the other; letting the left trigger and the auto aim do the rest. I could’ve made a shaken not stirred martini reference but I don’t know any Bond references that weren’t made in this game. I thought the Moonraker and Golden Gun were from this movie! They aren’t from Goldeneye??!! Thats cool that they added so many references to the whole franchise though even though it was lost on me even now.\" Really wanted to give this game a chance but by todays FPS standards the controls have aged terribly. extraordinarily okay game misogyny is so back 6 features GoldenEye still gets right like almost no shooter and movie adaption today: This game certainly has a legendary status for not only being a catalyst of console FPS games but also for its phenomenal multiplayer where its just plain fun to blast away at your friends and scream at em for screenpeeking and picking oddjob. I had owned this game for years and not even touched the singleplayer mode so I finally got around to doing the actual campaign and its aight. The controls take some time to get used to for sure but once i got over the learning curve it was very smooth sailing. I think my main gripe with the game is just that I dont know how the game wanted me to play the whole time. Since the game was initially designed to be a gallery shooter before the devs switched to an FPS the levels are designed with a lot of \"choke points\" where there are a lot of enemies and one way to proceed. Naturally especially considering this game is a james bond game the correct move would be to cautiously take out all the enemies before proceeding to the next area. Unfortunately the game continues to spawn enemies infinitely if you decide to stay in one spot too long so sometimes a better play would be to throw caution to the wind and just run through everyone blasting them like its doom. Due to the fact that its hard to tell how the game wants you to play for each level plus the fact that each level is rather open and nonlinear allowing the player to get lost frequently it all blends together to create a rather unbalanced gameplay experience. The soundtrack is good and graphically the environments are very nice looking on the N64 with far draw distances for the system and not too much slowdown. Once again the multiplayer is some of the most fun you can have on the N64. All in all great with friends eh by yourself. Very fun shooter and multiplayer]',\n",

I think it has a little bit of AA jank if you know what I mean so take that as a good or bad thing.\" Overall this is a fun game which ran great on my PC but there are some problems with it. Some of which become pretty clear after you play a while. \"This game is fun but it made my fingers hurt and the story wasnt even the entertaining kind of fun. The primal thrill of beating the shit out of vampires with your bare hands is great though.\" I feel deceived this is not a PS2 game at all. This is a beat for beat GoW18 clone just with trimmed down RPG and open world elements and pretty good at being that tbh! Combat got some nice schmoovement juggling stun states is nice love the jank schlock tone but pls show me a PS2 game with this much context sensitive navigation movement and attacking on R1 w Gears shooting lol.]',\n",
              " '[\"Gravity rush 2 is really jsut the first game but so much bigger. A huge world with new abilities that relate to how you use your shifting allow better use of combat. New characters fill the world with more personality as we learn about Kats origins. Sony I beg you to make a 3rd game\" \"Such a beautiful sequel to one of my favourite games. I really enjoyed all the improvements in terms of mission design (especially the side missions) and characters. I didnt like the stealth segments but I still appreciate the variety of the gameplay. The story was pretty good with a decently written villain. The gameplay itself (the gravity shifting) was as good as in the first game. You still have to get used to the controls but it feels so cool when youre able to e.g. fall upwards which is so awesome.\" This game gave me headaches but it was pretty cool aside from that. Even worse than the original and at half the framerate of the remaster. The original game was already janky enough. \"Even though this game has a lot of game play moments that made m put my head in my hands. None of that really matters to me because just moving around the world as Kat is so much fun. Shes such a awesome character and I love her to death shes dumb as hell gets a big head when she thinks people are complementing her quick to get angry and she gas a great heart. Raven is rad too!\" Pretty much takes everything the first game does and expands upon it. The worlds to explore are bigger the story is grander the soundtrack is STILL DONE BY OUR BOY KOHEI TANAKA this is the enhanced gravity rush experience. I will say though the story does kinda get kinda weird near the end though... Sony killed all the support for this game like only one year after it came out because they are party poopers and hate fun.]',\n",
              " '[\"One of the best Metroid games. Every issue I had with Prime 1 was fixed. Better bosses better world design better puzzles better beam combat. The only issue I can think of is that some of the bosses weakpoint isnt conveyed to the player clearly which could make a couple of bosses on a first playthrough frustrating and a real slog\" \"Echoes maybe fittingly for a game split between two worlds can be equally compelling and frustrating. It engages novel ideas for the franchise — inserting some survival horror mechanics into series that should be ripe for them — and taking on noticeable creative risks with its doubled worlds and augmented difficulty. But it wears out its welcome well before the end with an overlong fetch quest that fails to recapture the flow of the first games artifact hunt and its world while atmospheric and gloomy only really has one aesthetically-arresting zone. Couple that with one of the worst final boss fights Ive ever played and generally overburdened combat throughout and its a hard game to recommend to anyone who isnt already deep into the series marginalia.\" Taking pretty much everything the original game did expanding and refining it Prime 2 is simply one of the best games in the entire Metroid franchise. The dichotomy of the Dark World allows the game to keep the backtracking elements Prime 1 was infamous for but implement them in a way that is significantly less obtrusive and unintuitive. And while it takes a bit to get there it has some beautiful art direction with Sanctuary Fortress standing out as incredibly striking and beautiful and I’m willing to bet it would look even better with an HD remaster like the first game got. Luckily this game also rectified of Prime 1’s unfortunate flaws a lack of an ending escape timer and it does it in a great and memorable way having you face off against Dark Samus in one of the coolest confrontations in the series while on the clock to the entire Dark Aether dimension being destroyed. Overall this is an undeniable classic that anyone who is interested in Metroid should get around to playing. 1 step forward 1.01 steps back. Ultimately Prime 2 is still an utterly fantastic game but it just doesnt reach the same highs as Prime 1.n                     n                     Like Prime Echoess atmosphere is top-notch. Rather than aiming for a lonely atmosphere like Prime Echoes aims for a significantly more oppressive and terrifying feel and it absolutely succeeds. The Dark Aether areas are genuinely unsettling at times with their Silent Hill-esque music and body-horror visual design.n                     n                     Its hard to really elucidate what makes Echoes a little less great than Prime but I think it really comes down to the backtracking. I know \"lmao Echoes backtracking\" is a meme but it really does drag the game out longer than it needs to. In particular returning to the Temple Grounds after every main area and the Sky Temple key hunt during the endgame are the biggest culprits.n                     n                     The much higher level of difficulty is also a point of contention in the community but I always found Prime 1 to be a little too easy to Echoess greater challenge is welcome in my eyes. The final boss in particular was an excellent challenge.n                     n                     Overall Echoes is still an excellent game despite not being quite as good as Prime 1 and in my eyes is nonetheless a worthy sequel that adds almost as much as it subtracts from Prime 1. \"The coolest part about Metroid is being alone in a vast and hostile environment. In Dark Aether youre maybe the only being capable of speech in the whole universe and the air damages you. It doesnt get more alone or hostile than that.\" weaker than the firsti think still pretty good]',\n",

The combat is really terrible and the story breaks down really hard at the end but the aesthetic is unmatched. What a vibe what a head trip. An great idea however there are a few points that should be considered when talking about this game: \"A great game both in spite and because of its connections to the masterful Chrono Trigger. While it took me a little while to come to grips with the combat system I wound up liking it a lot once I did. The storys really existential and fascinating if clunky and convoluted. Absolutely excellent music and art direction with its bright colors saturating coral reefs and coastal towns. It may not be Chrono Trigger but it makes a statement all its own\" \"Im more of a Chrono Trigger guy myself but Ive tried to enjoy this game. I attempted to sit down and play this game 3 separate times throughout the years... but each attempt always ends with me putting the game down.

Its unfortunate it costs so much for the western copy nowadays.\" \"Best game of all time Ike is awesome and the best video game protagonist ever also hes gay and thats very cool methinks\" The year was 2014 back when Donkey Kong Country was still a household name. My first time experiencing Fire Emblem was through my sister recommending me to check out Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance citing it as a creation made by the team behind Super Paper Mario which we loved dearly. Using the power of emulation I got it completely playable on Dolphin where she took the helm and played it the whole way through. And surely Intelligent Systems was indeed responsible for making one of the most riveting tales told on the GCN 2nd behind Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. A lot of people see this as the quintessential Fire Emblem game as well as the peak. It gets close but I think the reason why people deem that is because of its heightened fantasy elements. Instead of having only Manaketes as supposed “sub-humans” which is a funny play on racism the Manaketes were renamed to Dragon Laguz because that’s what they are essentially. Laguz are humanoid creatures that can turn into either Lynxes Saber Toothed Tigers Lions Crows Hawks White Herons and of course Dragons. Despite there being 3 Laguz nations I actually listed every Laguz species I could think of which shows how memorable this game is. Now compare that to Berwick Saga released the exact same year. Berwick Saga has only Dragons where they are nearly extinct and could’ve been written out of Berwick Saga entirely considering they were used to explain the past of Berwick’s world which is far cooler in my opinion. Not that the added fantasy elements to FE9 are bad it just feels a little off to me considering your opponent in FE9 is still a human “Beorc” nation with a refined Imperial Army with Izuka experimenting on how to use the Laguz to Daein’s advantage a concept which came to fruition in FE10 and was one of the many good things that game pulled off despite the overambition. I remember my sister and I watching this cutscene from FE9 in 2014 where my father literally asked me how the heck this great red lion turned into a man and I couldn’t help but think about how silly this 2005 CG cutscene looked when I first saw it. \"another fun enough map-clicking mice-moving experience but doesnt inspire much the level of thought Id like out of my rpg brain and that really bothers me!\"]',\n",

Lots of math and space puzzles ranging in difficulty from braindeadly easy to getting bludgeoned over the head with a hammer to both at the same time. It certainly is cool to think outside the metaphorical box but it did also kinda make me paranoid about whether or not the puzzle instructions werent another trick question or not. The story was fun even if it makes less sense the more you think about it. There was heart put into it and I can appreciate that. There was also a surprising amount of animated cutscenes that really took me by surprise as well. Overall game is aight but my head hurts now\" This is fun to pick up and play now and then especially on mobile but it is quite limited gameplay wise and has way too many annoying (aka not clever) puzzles to be engaging for longer than 20 minutes at a time. Lots of fun brain teasers mixed together with a charming little story. They dont do an amazing job with fitting the puzzles into the story (not that Id expect them to) but they do have a few moments where it either ties in to whats happening or a character has a personality based around puzzle types that can be pretty fun. There is a heavy reuse of puzzle types the further you get though. Even most of the bonus puzzles you can unlock are just the same ones youve done before but on \"hard mode\". a great introduction to the series with an amazing artstyle music and some cool misteries though i wish they gave you the chance to solve them yourself instead of being exposed to the solution at the end (which is weird considering the entire premise of the game is to solve puzzles). Although not all puzzles are equally gret throughout the whole game they alone would be enough to hold up an entire game even without the charming story and atmosphere Taken me a while to get around to playing and glad I’ve finally taken my first step in this series.

The castaways arent just for the story as they can grant you access to items or other services as well as the ability to eliminate roadblocks in the world.

The writing is pretty poo poo though. \"The core gameplay of this game is so strong that Im giving it 5 stars even though there are obvious areas for improvement.  Going into this I had heard that the card combat was solid but that 2/3 of the game was Persona style conversations with your teammates.  Superficially thats true.  However the loop of:\" \"im playing as Lord Farquad/Bruno Bucciarati and its great\" What was kind of a slow start started turning into an amazing game. The dialogue originally put me off but I eventually got used to it. Sometimes you just want a game with 70% of it being hanging with your bros (who happen to be super heroes) and 30% of it being a deep card battle tactics game. Im surprised to a degree difficult to be concise upon. I actually tried to cheese the Steam refund policy with this game; playing the game exclusively offline for the first two weeks very much expecting it to be so bad Id need to refund it... and now here I stand quite frustrated that my achievements from those initial unrecorded 10+ hours of gameplay are missing. It is not without fault mind you buggy textures wobbly writing they somehow made Blade more annoying than Captain Marvel weirdness like that. However the gameplay is really sublime. I originally felt the card format would be a hinderance towards what I was seeing as the main innovation the lack of tile movement but have been proven quite wrong. The game so excellently subdues its RNG to a degree quite unlike the former X-COM devs I know and despise the game plays like a card game of sorts with the explosive always just off of OTKs you achieve and the deckbuilding I always appreciate. The difficulty scaling is for the most part rather fantastic with my current playthrough having just recently reached max difficulty. Its hard to go so in-depth without this all devolving into a bunch of disjointed points so Ill try to give my overall opinion: \"Its a pretty good game that is so distinctly of this era. (writing/game design trends) However where it trend chases it feels weak and I feel that it if it focused on the core of the game it would be significantly better. However on that however a part of me feels an over-tuned version of what I like in the game could very likely make another X-COM2. (A game Im not fond of but maybe that could have been a good thing for those who do) El estilo de combate por turnos combinado con cartas y movimiento y uso del entorno es super entretenido. Esto sumado a las habilidades de cada personaje y a la cantidad de estos hace que el combate sea super disfrutable.

The multiplayer is really where this game shines its chaotic and unbalanced but honestly its a Nintendo game so its ok. One amazing point of the game though is its Splatfests which at the time were fantastic ways to get involved in the Splatoon community through posting art on Miiverse and getting hyped up for your side. When this game had its final Splatfest it was genuinely an emotional moment playing till the Splatfest ended (Team Callie BTW).

Sense of direction was iffy but fun game. Loved the puzzles and actiony parts Se habla mucho de Inside y Limbo por el origen de uno de los creadores de Somerville y bastante de Inside hay (no de Limbo). Sin embargo para entender del todo la experiencia que ofrece sería necesario mencionar Another World. Aunque aquí no se llega a empuñar ni una pistola (ni un escudo) y las mecánicas asociadas a los poderes del personaje se utilizan básicamente para resolver puzzles detrás hay un intento de contar la interacción entre una inteligencia humana y una alienígena sin utilizar la palabra. Todo se sostiene sobre la imagen y esas mecánicas de las que hablo. Una propuesta valiente por hacer algo menos masticadito de lo que suele ser habitual. La pena es que la historia funciona mejor como sucesión de secuencias que como un todo bien atado algo que también afecta al desarrollo de la acción. Y cuesta encontrarle el sentido a las acciones que acomete el personaje. Con esto en mente Somerville queda como una experiencia irregular con algunos diseños chulos buena música tres o cuatro puzzles muy bien pensados y la sensación de que hubiera necesitado más tiempo/dinero para alcanzar lo que sobre el papel parecía una buena idea.]',\n",

I’d buy it but it’s basically always on sale at lower and lower prices so I’ll wait until my Switch backlog is thin. A very solid game! I thought the first Mario + Rabbids game was surprisingly good but I think this is a really solid improvement. A wider roster varied locations and a somewhat revamped combat system are all great! Normally not a huge fan of this genre but the Mario brand combined with Grant Kirkhope’s score and its writing is enough to keep me on the board for the most part.

There are also these cards that you can combine to give yourself various effects and those cards are also locked behind random enemy drops. I would have liked it more if the cards were something you naturally found around the map rather than something that you have to grind for. The last bit of the game becomes a bit of a slog with the second to last boss being in a particularly annoying to reach area and the final boss being really cheaply designed imo.

It feels pretty atmospheric with some interesting music and you do feel like youre descending into this scary alien planet. Unfortunately the lack of map and all the environments looking very similar (especially when it never got a colour version for the GBC) make it incredibly difficult to navigate.

The misadventures of the Prince of Sable (Note that hurts me to write: the Assist Trophy guy that turns into a frog) got me thinking about how the consoles library tends to stick out from a lot of Nintendos usual lineup. I was originally going to write something longer about that game itself pointing to how Game Boy games having a smaller technical scope and perhaps a looser leash than their console counterparts could enable them to explore more unique narratives. In particular the role of the protagonist is oddly subversive across the library.

              " '[Shenmue is definitely a game that will never be made again and I mean that in both a good and a bad way. The amount of attention to detail that this game had in 1999 is unparalleled for its time. It truly is Yu Suzukis magnum opus as he decided to create a virtual living breathing community of people and in a lot of ways he succeeded. Because of the less traditional approach that was made to create this game a less traditional mindset needs to be had to really enjoy this kind of game ngl. I think a good modern equivalent would be something like death stranding a game where if you are able to slow down to the pace that the game asks of you theres a lot to be had in the sort of atmospheric sense but if you are going into the game expecting to play it like any other game focusing on major goals and objectives as skillfully and efficiently as possible then you are probably gonna be really bored and frustrated at the game. And thats not me trying to say \"if you have that kind of mindset you wouldnt understand shenmue\" but more me saying \"this game is not for everyone and you should definitely know that going in if you want to experience this game to its fullest\". You gotta play on the games terms and not really on your own in that sense. The gameplay just revolves asking people various things to get various hints on where to go next and once you go to the next place you ask the people in that place where to go and the cycle continues until you piece together the greater picture of whats going on. My reccomendation is just to give it a shot and you will probably know within the first few hours whether or not the game is for you. The entire game is a slog but in the best way possible. Played the HD remaster on Steam Deck for this one. Despite being an older game that’s definitely showing its age it still feels so grand - to the point where the ending gave me chills.

I think that while it is a totally valid opinion to see all the monotonous walking around from place to place and the absolutely bullshit story riddles that require you to sift through a neigh 50 page guidebook of literal nonsense in order to figure out what random backass code the game wants you to put in to proceed in the game and think that the game is not good due to it not being very fun or interesting as a lot of \"mainstream\" game reviews have said. But the weird thing is that I feel like the monotony and convolution is entirely intentional. The creators were aware of it. The game is aware of it. And the game uses those boring gameplay moments to craft its whole narrative around and it makes something really unique. Something fresh that Ive never really played before. And I think because of it the game is certainly worth trying out even if you dont see it through to the end. \"not having played any other suda51s games i think i made a major mistake by playing this one first\" haha suda ur so quirky \"one of the most unique time loop stories ever told and the natural continuation of sudas more subtle thematic offerings. there is no universe in which this game isnt incredible\"]',\n",

The game also lacks the special level of polish and attention to detail that nintendo puts in smash as well which just makes the overall experience underwhelming.

I think I am a bit spoiled having played 13 Sentinels first though. The faces are barely animated at all in this one and while I think it works for characters like Odin it does not do any favors for characters like Mercedes and Oswald. It makes everything they say feel a bit sarcastic (though this is not a jab at the english VA I liked it quite a bit). Far and away my biggest problem with this game is the structure. Each “book” has you playing as a different character who all play pretty different though being me I gravitated towards the nigh-uncontrollable flippy-dippy melee fighters. But with these characters you are going through the same 8ish areas fighting the same 30ish enemies ending with one of the same 10ish bosses in each level and it gets old really fast. I understand these assets probably cost a ton to produce and reusing them is resourceful but it is so much padding. It negatively impacts the story too. Its a great simple concept: viewing the lives of the children of these classic fantasy archetypes with the conclusion that they are pretty much all horrible parents. However it feels forced to go in certain directions just so I can fight the damn blue worm dragon for like the 5th book in a row. Not all of it is bad I love seeing little details in one book heavily expanded and explained in another book (like seeing why Pooka ran the food store in book 1 explained in book 2). However while it would require pretty extensive rewrites I would’ve preferred a 10-15 hour game reusing less gameplay elements rather than a 35 hour journey that feels pretty tiring by the middle of book 3.

              " '[I played the sequel first and I think that permanently ruined this game for me. I played a little and I definitely need to finish it. Being in my pre-teen years at the time I loved the humor and gameplay in this game. It was tons of fun to ride around in the space ship glassing cities and probing people. The missions were also genuinely fun at least at the time. The 1950s were an overrated time in history. It was the first full post-war World War II decade that began the information age that we are still currently living in marked by a greater emphasis on progressing social changes and the quality of human life once we maximized exploration and industry production in decades prior. The economic boom created by the impact of WWII ushered in an era of prosperity and it seemed like the American dream had come true. Squeaky-clean conservative values defined the idyllic society that the 1950s upheld: waspy nuclear families where dad wore a suit and tie to his 9 to 5 and mom stayed home all day making dad dinner and cleaning the house. At the same time little Timmy played baseball with his friends and little Susie played with her dolls. Not only was the American dream of the 1950s eerily pristine but it was also boring. Even the leather-jacketed rock-and-roll counterculture seems like a quaint facet of the decade or maybe we have Fonzie to thank for making a mockery of it. To retain this halcyon society the 1950s upheld a strong sense of conformity with zero leeway for any abstract thought or anything outside the very anglo-centric heteronormative bubble encapsulating the decade. Extreme examples include the Red Scare and all of the anti-gay propaganda. Jim Crow segregation was still in full effect! Fortunately we’ve progressed substantially past this point in our history. Because the ideals of the 1950s seem antiquated and corny the decade is ripe for being made fun of. Five decades later Destroy All Humans! serves as a lampoon of 1950’s culture in the medium of gaming.

Vibrant art cohesive level themes creative bosses a bopping soundtrack and great applications of a grapple make this game sing.

Bosses also function a lot better here suffering much less from being stuck on the same spot for an infinite amount of time (aka Spark Mandrill Syndrome) now with an invincible enrage state where they do a mechanic that the player is forced to dodge around. Not only that but when you do get damaged your HP bar still maintains a bit of the damage you took as Red so if you swap your character out you can regenerate a bit of health (much like MVC for instance!)I also really like that the chip mechanic swaps out finding heart tanks in the stages specially considering the micromanagement of 3 different characters would become hell.n                     n                     Now I praised most of MMXs stories before but they were always a bit undercooked.

The Rune system is simple but its still pretty enjoyable even if the main character basically has a \"win now\" Rune which kind of breaks battles. Regular battles go by rather quickly because each characters turn flows into the others so well (as long as youre not spamming Runes). I only Game Overed once due to lack of planning but the game is pretty easy all things considered. My biggest complaint is the lack of diverse battle music. Theres really only 2 battle tracks the whole game and the movement speed sans True Holy Rune is kind of a slog. Theres a lot of backtracking to get all 108 Stars of Destiny and the inventory management is... Less than stellar. The variety of battle styles is really neat and a fun idea but the large scale battles are easy to cheese. Its a fun RPG to run through with quite a bit of customization with parties which increases replayability. \"I had a good time with one of Konamis first attempts with the JRPG genre.

Good characters interesting endings with no bias towards a certain alignment and wonderful gameplay. this was the first smt game i have ever beaten fully (not counting persona) and it will probably remain one of my favorite smt games ever as a fan of strategy rpgs already the gameplay appealed to me. the objectives for maps are diverse and fun despite the maps being fairly simple the variety of objectives and layouts made it fun anyways. the games difficulty was fine though there are some fights i dislike. the story is fantastic. the scenario is immediately interesting and a lot of things happen very quickly which gets you hooked. the characters are all enjoyable and i felt bad when i missed a chance to talk to one of them. the time management system is pretty neat too. i have only finished amanes route but the characters are all compelling and the best part of the game to me is that when it came down to the point of picking my route i saw equal merit in all choices (except yuzus sorry yuzu youre still the number 1). usually in smt games there is a true ending and when theres not it usually seems like chaos is always the better option but in devil survivor i truly had trouble deciding which route i agreed with. the game also makes your choices matter not thinking ahead with your dialogue options and actions will result in the deaths of multiple characters and i like that. it made it feel like your decisions each day had weight. as for the parts of the game i dont like its beldr. he is basically the minotaur of devil survivor but beldr doesnt teach the player anything. he can only be killed by the protagonist with 1 specific physical move (physical being the worst attacking type in the game by far). the only thing i could say it teaches the player is to focus on objectives but still thats a stretch. other than that all the fights were fun the mechanics are fun. the auction system being the only way of getting demons is a bit annoying but overclocked fixes this. i would say this is a must play if you are a fan of smt and strategy rpgs (FUCK SHARP FE THIS IS THE REAL SMT X FE CROSSOVER)n                     n                     (also play overclocked i played the ds version but im sure overclocked improves on the game wholly)]',\n",

Both were the same games I had played on other systems but being able to take them on the go was great. They looked great played great and the inclusion of trophy support was a nice touch.

I think this game has been surpassed in some regard by games like Rogue Legacy/2 Hollow Knight and Hades now. It still stands as one of the most fun games in the genre though. I love it.

I feel like what this game suffers from the most is the complete lack of a strong hook for both gameplay and story especially. A lot of the time it just feels like the game doesnt really know which direction to go and it never gives itself a chance to really build up to the few parts that couldve otherwise had some actual impact. It didnt really pull it together until near the end which at that point it was kind of too late.\" \"This was my first Tales game and as it turns out it wasnt a great starting point.

The game is also pretty broken in terms of game balance its WAYYYY too easy to crack home run after home run. I think the presentation of the game is cool though the roster has a lot of interesting characters to make your team out of and you can even play during both the day and night which I always thought was cool. The stadiums to play in are super unique with fun gimmicks and aesthetics in each of them. Its a fun mario baseball game but not as good as its predecessor.\" This is the only sports game i actually enjoy. I have so many memories of playing this as a kid with my younger brother each moment was bliss Any game that I had fun with as a kid and that my friends still enjoy playing today already starts at 3 and a half stars for me. This game has so much love put into it and it is amazing how much fun can be had when there is really only one game mode I care about. This game has a great roster and there are so many hidden gems such as Toadsworth. (As soon as I learned how good of a pitcher he is I managed to piss off my friend so bad that he jumped on me in real life). You can play without RNG but having a little bit is a fun way to add some variety to the game and get angry reactions from friends which is always fun. Even the single player campaign is fun. My friends who grew up with it get a lot more out of it than anyone new to the game. Other party games that I have feel more accesable to new players.
